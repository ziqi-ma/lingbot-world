-----

We are excited to introduce **LingBot-World**, an open-sourced world simulator stemming from video generation. Positioned
as a top-tier world model, LingBot-World offers the following features. 
- **High-Fidelity & Diverse Environments**: It maintains high fidelity and robust dynamics in a broad spectrum of environments, including realism, scientific contexts, cartoon styles, and beyond. 
- **Long-Term Memory & Consistency**: It enables a minute-level horizon while preserving contextual consistency over time, which is also known as long-term memory. 
- **Real-Time Interactivity & Open Access**: It supports real-time interactivity, achieving a latency of under 1 second when producing 16 frames per second. We provide public access to the code and model in an effort to narrow the divide between open-source and closed-source technologies. We believe our release will empower the community with practical applications across areas like content creation, gaming, and robot learning.

## ⚙️ Quick Start
This codebase is built upon [Wan2.2](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.2). Please refer to their documentation for installation instructions.
### Installation
Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/robbyant/lingbot-world.git
cd lingbot-world
```
Install dependencies:
```sh
# Ensure torch >= 2.4.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install [`flash_attn`](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention):
```sh
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```
### Model Download

Download models using huggingface-cli:
```sh
pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download robbyant/lingbot-world-base-cam --local-dir ./lingbot-world-base-cam
```
Download models using modelscope-cli:
 ```sh
pip install modelscope
modelscope download robbyant/lingbot-world-base-cam --local_dir ./lingbot-world-base-cam
```
### Inference
Before running inference, you need to prepare:
- Input image
- Text prompt
- Control signals (optional, can be generated from a video using [ViPE](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/vipe))
  - `intrinsics.npy`: Shape `[num_frames, 4]`, where the 4 values represent `[fx, fy, cx, cy]`
  - `poses.npy`: Shape `[num_frames, 4, 4]`, where each `[4, 4]` represents a transformation matrix in OpenCV coordinates

- 480P:
``` sh
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 480*832 --ckpt_dir lingbot-world-base-cam --image examples/00/image.jpg --action_path examples/00 --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --frame_num 161 --prompt "The video presents a soaring journey through a fantasy jungle. The wind whips past the rider's blue hands gripping the reins, causing the leather straps to vibrate. The ancient gothic castle approaches steadily, its stone details becoming clearer against the backdrop of floating islands and distant waterfalls."
```
- 720P:
``` sh
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 720*1280 --ckpt_dir lingbot-world-base-cam --image examples/00/image.jpg --action_path examples/00 --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --frame_num 161 --prompt "The video presents a soaring journey through a fantasy jungle. The wind whips past the rider's blue hands gripping the reins, causing the leather straps to vibrate. The ancient gothic castle approaches steadily, its stone details becoming clearer against the backdrop of floating islands and distant waterfalls."
```
Alternatively, you can run inference without control actions:
``` sh
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 480*832 --ckpt_dir lingbot-world-base-cam --image examples/00/image.jpg --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --frame_num 161 --prompt "The video presents a soaring journey through a fantasy jungle. The wind whips past the rider's blue hands gripping the reins, causing the leather straps to vibrate. The ancient gothic castle approaches steadily, its stone details becoming clearer against the backdrop of floating islands and distant waterfalls."
```
Tips:
If you have sufficient CUDA memory, you may increase the `frame_num` parameter to a value such as 961 to generate a one-minute video at 16 FPS. Otherwise if the CUDA memory is not sufficient, you may use ``--t5_cpu`` to decrease the memory usage.

### Quantized Model for Limited GPU Resources

For users with limited GPU memory, we recommend using a **4-bit quantized version** of LingBot-World-Base (Cam), which significantly reduces GPU memory consumption while maintaining competitive visual quality for inference.

👉 Download link: https://huggingface.co/cahlen/lingbot-world-base-cam-nf4

> ⚠️ Note: This quantized model is intended **for inference only**. Minor degradation in visual fidelity and temporal consistency may occur compared to the full-precision model.

### Demo Results
We provide comparison demos where camera parameters are estimated by [ViPE](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/vipe) from original videos downloaded from [Genie3](https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/):
